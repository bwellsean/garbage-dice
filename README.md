Dumpster Dice

Dumpster Dice (also known as Garbage Dice) is a digital recreation of the fast-paced dice game where players race to fill numbered slots on a trash can lid. Roll, claim, and outlast your opponents to become the last player with dice remaining!

Built using React + Vite, this online version keeps gameplay snappy, colorful, and multiplayer-friendly for local play.

🎮 How to Play

Goal:
Be the last player with dice remaining!

Setup:

Choose the number of players (2–4).

Each player enters their name and selects a color.

Every player starts with 20 dice.

Gameplay:

On your turn, click “Roll Dice”.

If your roll matches an empty slot (1–6) on the lid, place your die there.

If that slot is already taken, your die goes into the dumpster.

The player who fills the final empty slot collects all dice from the lid.

Play continues until a player runs out of dice — they’re eliminated.

The last player with dice wins!

Resetting:
At any time, you can click the red reset button in the bottom-right corner to start over.
